/**
 * This is a simple master/worker pattern.
 *
 * The master thread creates an instance of the pattern, provides work items to be processed,
 * and is signaled upon completion.  The master thread may wait for completion (synchronous) or
 * may poll for completion (asynchronous).
 *
 * A master/worker pattern may be static or dynamic.  In a static master/worker, execution
 * proceeds in two distinct phases - first all of the work items are submitted and then
 * the workers execute by consuming work items.  Work items may not be submitted once
 * execution has begun.  In a dynamic master/worker, submission of work and the execution of
 * workers proceeds concurrently.  Furthermore, a worker task may opt to add new work items
 * during its execution.
 *
 * @param <S> indicates the type of the input work item.
 * @param <T> indicates the type of the output work item.
