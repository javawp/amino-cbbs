Provides the classes and interfaces for a simple master/worker pattern.
 <p>
The master thread creates an instance of the pattern, provides work items to be processed,
and is signaled upon completion.  The master thread may wait for completion (synchronous) or 
may poll for completion (asynchronous).  
 <p>
A master/worker pattern may be static or dynamic.  In a static master/worker, execution
proceeds in two distinct phases - first all of the work items are submitted and then 
the workers execute by consuming work items.  Work items may not be submitted once
execution has begun.  In a dynamic master/worker, submission of work and the execution of
workers proceeds concurrently.  Furthermore, a worker task may opt to add new work items
during its execution.
